So, have you worked your brain out on the 9*9 grids\n
\n
in the newspaper each morning... \n
\n
only to find your cup of brewing coffee turn cold later?\n
\n
Lost putting numbers in the squares at the back benches \n
\n
of the class or in the public transport? \n
\n
We value your passion and it is time you were rewarded for it.\n</item>
