\n
\nDesign an autonomous vehicle which is capable of following black line on a white surface by filling
\n
\nthe gaps on the track with fillers that has to be detected on the track and indicating different stations.
\n
\n? General Rules:
\n
\n• The participant must be a regular student of AICTE approved /UGC recognized Technical or
\n
\nManagement Institute.
\n
\n• All students must have a valid identity card of their respective educational institute.
\n
\n• Any team that is not ready at the time specified will be eliminated from the competition
\n
\nautomatically.
\n
\n• The team must adhere to the spirit of healthy competition. Judges reserve the right to disqualify
\n
\nany team indulged in misbehavior.
\n
\n• Certificate of excellence will be awarded to all the winners.
\n
\n• Participants from different institutes may form a team.
\n
\n• Event rules can be subjected to change.
\n
\n• Damaging any property (arena/systems) will lead to the disqualification.
\n
\n• Participants should not have any objection on the predefined rules.
\n
\n• Judges decision shall be treated as final and binding on all.
\n
\n•Involvement of a participant in two teams is strictly prohibited,
\n
\nviolating this rule will lead to disqualification of both the teams.
\n
\n? ROBOT specification and Gameplay:-
\n
\n•The microcontroller on-board must be an 8-bit microcontroller
\n
\n• Line will be of 2 cm width.
\n
\n• The filler for the gaps will be completely cubic in nature ,white in color of size 6x6x6 cm.
\n
\n• The stations will be completely white in color of size 15x3x6 cm.
\n
\n• The gaps will be of dimenssion 7x7x7 cm.
\n
\n• The stations has to be indicated using led or buzzer but the number of indication will denote the
\n
\nstation number suppose led blinking twice or buzzer buzzing twice indicates the second station .
\n
\n• Before filling the gaps the fillers need to be detected which has to be indicated using a buzzer or a
\n
\nled.
\n
\n• The fillers can be pushed into the gap or can also be placed into the gap using a gripper.
\n
\n• The room in which the event will take place will be relatively dark.
\n
\n• Maximum team size must be 4 members.
\n
\n• Robots must be autonomous and in case of external power supply the wire must remain slacked all
\n
\nthe time.
\n
\n• LEGO kits are not allowed, however the participants can use readymade sensors, microcontroller
\n
\nboards, chassis and programmers.
\n
\n• Maximum dimensions of the robot should be 25*25*25 cm.
\n
\n• The power supply for the vehicle cn be on-board/off-board, and should not exceed 15V
\n
\n• The event consists of two rounds: – Elimination round and the Final round.
\n
\n• The track will consist of sharp 90 turns.
\n
\n• Nudging/Pushing or any type of manual handling of the robot will lead to cancellation of that run.
\n
\n• The path will of black colour on a white background.
\n
\n• The organizers will ensure that the track is located within a typical indoor environment in so far as
\n
\nis feasible. No request to adjust the lighting shall be entertained.
