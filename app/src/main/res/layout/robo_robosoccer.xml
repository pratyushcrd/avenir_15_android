\n
\nDesign a manually controlled mechanical bot, which can push or kick a medium sized plastic ball.
\n
\nThe prime motive of this game is to push or kick the ball in opponent\'s goalpost and avoid the ball
\n
\nfrom going into yours. Confinement of the ball by any sort of mechanism of the bot for more than
\n
\n10 seconds will be treated as penalty.
\n
\n-The bot taking less time will be qualified. (Round 1)
\n
\n-The bot with more goals (point) will win the game. (Knockout and finals).
\n
\n NOTE-IF A KNOCKOUT MATCH REMAINS GOAL LESS THEN THE TEAM WHICH TOOK LESS TIME TO
\n
\nQUALIFY FOR THE KNOCKOUTS WILL GO FOR THE NEXT ROUND.TIME ALLOTED FOR KNOCKOUTS
\n
\nIS 4 MINUTES
\n
\nROUND 1:
\n
\nIt will be a time trial round where the bot needs to score goals by passing some obstacles (defenders)
\n
\nin minimum time. A number of balls will be there in different parts of the arena and the bot will have
\n
\nto put all the balls inside the goalpost.
\n
\nROUND 2:
\n
\nTop 32 teams will be selected from the first round on the basis of best timing of round 1 and then one
\n
\nto one knockout match will be played. Points will be more if the bot can score the goal from the
\n
\npenalty box. Moving goal keeper will be present in this round (a part of the arena).if the bot can
\n
\nscore without hitting the goalkeeper, then more points!!!
\n
\nNOTE- THE KNOCKOUT AND THE ROUND OF TOP 16 WILL BE PLAYED ON THE 2ND DAY AND THE
\n
\nQUARTER FINAL, SEMI FINAL AND THE FINAL ON THE 3RD DAY.
\n
\nSELECTED TEAMS WILL BE NOTIFIED. THE TEAMS ARE ALSO REQUESTED TO FOLLOW THE
